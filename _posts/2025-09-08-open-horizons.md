## What is this?

_Open Horizons_ is a growth framework designed to help you clarify your direction, nurture your strengths, and maintain momentum. It’s a flexible, principle-driven approach that adapts to your unique context and evolves with you.

### Why this works (design choices)

What stood out about this process for one user:
> Three bits that were revelations for me:
>
> 1. List out 3 things you're most proud of from your work over the last few years.
> 2. What do you see others accomplishing that you want to do too?
> 3. These are hard and will take many years. Make sure they energize you by virtue of aligning with your mission.
>
> Those first two nudged me to: name what motivates me, surface the growth endeavors I'm most proud of, and study the accomplishments of the people I look up to.
>
> The last one was essential in making me think big. It instructed me to _not_ think about things that I could accomplish in ~5 months, but instead aim bigger. That bigger aim ended up being critical to the inspirations that I took from this process.

These design choices are the engine that makes Open Horizons work in real life. They anchor you in reality, point you toward concrete exemplars, and force a long horizon. In practice:

- **Reality anchor (proud achievements).** Starting from lived impact prevents vanity goals. You see what actually produced outcomes for you—contexts, behaviors, strengths—and can deliberately do more of that.
- **Aspirational modeling (admired accomplishments).** Naming who you look up to and what they’ve achieved injects direction, standards, and concrete examples. It turns "grow" into "grow toward this," which accelerates learning.
- **Energy gate + horizon (years, not months).** By encouraging long‑horizon, energizing aims, you avoid short‑termism and pick pursuits that can sustain effort through setbacks. This keeps the system inspiring instead of becoming another checklist.

Together, these are _design choices_—how the system is built. The next section covers the _principles_—the beliefs that the rituals are meant to practice.

_Net effect:_ these prompts create a closed loop between **what’s real**, **what’s possible**, and **what’s worth years of your life** — a loop many growth systems skip.

## Principles

If the previous section explained the engine, this section defines the fuel. Principles set the foundation for what we practice; without them, rituals risk becoming empty motions. With them, rituals become ways to practice what matters. Small, repeatable actions embed principles into daily life—keeping you aligned, adaptable, and building habits that support your growth. _Learn it first through ritual. Then, as you grok the principles, make it your own by adapting the rituals._

1. **Aim With Clarity**
   Define what success means to you. Clarity in your aims helps you make better decisions, focus your energy, and measure progress meaningfully. Without clear aims, effort can scatter and motivation wane. In other words, _You’re more likely to get where you want to go if you know where you’re going._
2. **Nurture a Growth Mindset**
   Embrace learning and development as ongoing processes. Recognize strengths and weaknesses without judgment and see challenges as opportunities to grow rather than threats.
3. **Planning Over Plans**
   Prioritize adaptability and momentum over rigid adherence to plans. Use planning as a tool to guide your actions, not as a constraint that stifles responsiveness or creativity.
4. **Sustain Momentum**
   Sustain momentum by regularly reflecting, celebrating wins, and making thoughtful adjustments. Build margin to absorb shocks and enable bold swings, ensuring your growth remains dynamic, resilient, and adaptable.
5. **Leverage Strengths**
   Build on what energizes and empowers you. While growth areas are important, your strengths are your foundation for success and resilience. By naming and revisiting your strengths, you prime yourself to use them more often—practice that compounds, turning strengths into superpowers.

## Nested Feedback Loops

A healthy growth system relies on nested feedback loops operating at different scales. Small-scale rituals, like daily focus or weekly reviews, strengthen and inform larger ones such as quarterly reflections and mission affirmations. Conversely, these larger-scale rituals guide and protect the smaller ones, creating a dynamic balance that sustains growth.

Don’t drop a ritual without substituting something that preserves the same signal at the same scale. If a practice is removed, it’s essential to explicitly replace it with something that provides feedback at the same scale and frequency to maintain this balance. Think of it as "defense in depth"—if one ritual misses something, another catches it, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks. This layered approach to feedback keeps your growth system resilient and responsive.

## Rituals in Detail

<a id="1-reflect-on-achievements"></a>
### 1. Reflect on Achievements

Reflection on your achievements serves as an essential anchor in your growth journey. By regularly reviewing what you have accomplished and the impact you have made, you reinforce your sense of progress and build confidence. This ritual helps you stay grounded in reality, ensuring that your aims remain connected to tangible outcomes and meaningful success.
 [↳ Example](#reflect-example)

#### What

Reflecting on achievements involves reviewing your significant accomplishments and the impact they have created. This ritual helps anchor your growth journey in tangible results and real-world outcomes.

#### Why

It grounds your personal growth in reality, boosting confidence and providing a clear foundation for setting future aims with clarity.

#### Criteria

- Identify three significant accomplishments from recent years.
- Focus on impact, not just tasks completed.
- Use evidence like performance notes, resumes, or LinkedIn profiles.

#### Tips

- Review impact/performance notes and your resume/LinkedIn.
- Share your list with a peer or mentor for perspective.
- Maintain a simple “wins” log to make future reflections easier.
- Consider keeping a running “brag document” ([Julia Evans’s guide](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)) to capture wins as they happen.
- Make a short "Admired Achievements" list: who do you look up to, and what are they accomplishing that you want to do too?

#### Adaptations

Try alternative reflection methods like informal conversations, visual timelines, or storytelling to capture your impact in ways that feel natural to you.



<a id="2-recognize-strengths"></a>
### 2. Recognize Strengths

Understanding and leveraging your strengths is vital for sustainable growth. This ritual encourages you to identify the qualities and skills that energize you, enabling you to focus your efforts where you are most effective. Recognizing strengths not only builds confidence but also helps you approach challenges with resilience and a positive mindset.
 [↳ Example](#strengths-example)

#### What

This ritual involves identifying your personal strengths—the qualities, skills, and behaviors that energize and empower you.

#### Why

Recognizing strengths helps you build sustainable growth by leveraging what you do best. Keeping strengths visible elevates them in your daily decisions, making you more likely to use them—usage that strengthens them further.

#### Criteria

- Identify moments when you felt energized or confident.
- Gather feedback from peers and managers.
- Use tools like Working Genius or StrengthsFinder as inputs, not definitive labels.

#### Tips

- Request feedback from peers and managers.
- Use strengths assessment tools to supplement self-awareness.
- Keep your top 3–5 strengths visible (sticky note, doc header, home screen) to cue their use.

#### Adaptations

Consider journaling your experiences or having informal peer conversations to uncover strengths in a way that fits your style.



<a id="3-affirm-your-mission"></a>
### 3. Affirm Your Mission

A clear and compelling personal mission provides direction and motivation. This ritual invites you to articulate your core purpose and guiding principles, serving as a compass that aligns your efforts and decisions. Regularly affirming your mission helps maintain focus and inspires commitment to your growth journey.
 [↳ Example](#mission-example)

#### What

Writing a personal mission statement that captures your core purpose and guiding principles.

#### Why

A clear mission statement serves as a compass, focusing your energy and filtering distractions.

#### Criteria

- Reflect on past achievements and strengths to ensure authenticity.
- The mission should energize you and align with your values.

#### Tips

- Keep your mission visible and revisit it regularly.
- Express your mission through conversations, visual boards, or core values.

<a id="4-aim--set-priorities"></a>
### 4. Aim & Set Priorities

Setting clear and focused priorities is crucial for maintaining momentum and direction. This ritual guides you to define a limited number of growth areas that challenge you and align with your mission. By concentrating your efforts, you can make meaningful progress without becoming overwhelmed.
 [↳ Example](#aims-example)

#### What

Define no more than three key growth areas each quarter that stretch you and align with your mission.

#### Why

Focused aims help maintain momentum and prevent overwhelm. Aim bigger than a few months—think in years. These aims should be difficult and energizing because they align with your mission.

#### Criteria

- Long-horizon: Likely to span years, not months.
- Hard: Worth stretching for.
- Important: Directly linked to your mission.
- Viable: Leverages strengths and has support.
- Few: Limit to three priorities.

#### Tips

- Reflect on what would amplify past wins.
- Discuss priorities with peers to test relevance and feasibility.

#### Adaptations

Try shorter cycles, flexible themes, or evolving focus areas to keep intentionality without rigidity.



<a id="5-weekly-review"></a>
### 5. Weekly Review

Regularly reviewing your weekly progress keeps your growth aligned and adaptable. This ritual helps break down priorities into manageable tasks, allowing you to adjust plans as needed and maintain steady momentum. Weekly reviews foster accountability and ensure you stay connected to your broader aims.
 [↳ Example](#weekly-review-example)

#### What

Break down quarterly priorities into 3–5 actionable tasks each week.

#### Why

## Credits

This framework was inspired and informed by the works and teachings of:

- [The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins) by Michael D. Watkins. This helped me understand the importance of the first 90 days in a new role, and success through a learning mindset. After my coach helped me apply these ideas to be successful in new roles, I got the idea of making this a rolling 90-day plan that supports my growth.
- [Stategy and Tactics](https://goldrattresearchlabs.com/pdf/other-authors/_Strategy_and_Tactics__-_by_Eli_Goldratt,_Rami_Gol.PDF) by Eli Goldratt, Rami Goldratt and Eli Abramov. While it may be obvious to all of you, the idea of a hierarchy of strategy and tactic (and strategy and tactic nested under them) was a revelation to me. I've used this idea to help me think about my priorities and how they relate to my mission.
- [The Path Between The Seas](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Path-Between-the-Seas/David-McCullough/9780743262132) by David McCullough. This book helped me understand that we can in fact emark on projects that we have no idea how to complete. We can learn and discover as we go.
- [Outcomes over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes) by Joshua Seiden. It's not about the output, it's about the outcomes we achieve. So a planning system that focuses on outcomes and pushes out plans until the last minute makes sense and is worth bragging about.
- The Working Genius [book](https://www.workinggenius.com/) and [podcast](https://workinggeniuspodcast.libsyn.com/) by Patrick Lencioni. This helped me understand that we each have strengths, and we should leverage them and not lament all the weaknesses we have. He also helped me not feel guilty about my habit of [asking people why they're doing things](https://www.tablegroup.com/88-the-power-of-daily-disruption/) and urging them to reconsider whether what they're doing is the best way to meet their goals.
- Glenn Vanderburg’s paper [Extreme Programming Annealed](https://vanderburg.org/writing/xpannealed.pdf) sharpened my understanding of reinforcing processes. He showed that healthy systems rely on nested feedback loops at multiple scales, and that if you remove a practice, you must replace it with something that provides feedback at the same level. That framing deeply influenced how I think about Open Horizons.
- My coach, Daphne who helps me embrace a growth mindset and apply it to my whole life.
- The dozens of friends, people I've mentored and teammates who've tried past versions of the framework and helped me make it better.
- Many thanks to Jason Rudolph, Jay Floyd and Ale Cabrera for reading drafts of this and providing feedback that made it much better.

### Testimonials

Ale Cabrera:
> My imposter syndrome hasn't fully gone away, but we’re at peace now. When I start having the familiar feelings, I just look at my doc and I feel relieved. It works for me.

Jason Rudolph:
> Most growth systems seem to assume that your path should be determined by your strengths, or by the company's needs, or by the intersection of the two. For me, that's always resulted in a plan I've found uninspiring.
> Muness's system reveals the missing components: I needed to identify what motivates me, the growth endeavors that I'm most proud of, and the accomplishments of the people that I look up to. The result: A plan that truly inspires me and has guided me toward fulfilling growth for more than a year now.

## Embracing the Journey

Personal growth is not a destination but a continuous journey filled with reflection, adaptation, and discovery. Open Horizons invites you to revisit your aims regularly, nurture your strengths, and keep momentum through intentional rituals.

> “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” — Viktor Frankl

<a id="aims-example"></a>
### Aims (Outcomes & Possible Tactics)

#### Aim 1 — Build and Protect Margin — at Work and in Life

_Outcome:_ There is buffer to make better choices, absorb shocks, and take big swings.

_Tactics:_

- Evaluate opportunities by how they strengthen (not erode) margin.
- Choose contexts that support honesty, adaptability, and slack.
- Protect time for reflection and renewal; create “margin systems” at work (slack in schedules, space for experiments).
- Say “no” or “not now” to commitments that would erode margin.

#### Aim 2 — Create Leverage Through Technology as a Force-Multiplier

_Outcome:_ People and organizations achieve outcomes they couldn’t without new tools or approaches.

_Tactics:_

- Join or create roles where technology is central to strategy, not just execution.
- Run small prototypes that demonstrate behavior change (not just features).
- Document and share force-multiplier patterns; teach others to spot and build leverage.

#### Aim 3 — Enable Alignment and Resilience in How People Work

_Outcome:_ Teams operate with clarity, adaptability, and health—whether via management, consulting, or peer influence.

_Tactics:_

- Introduce lightweight strategy↔ops↔data rituals (e.g., alignment check-ins, explicit decision logs).
- Model alignment practices in any role, especially in ambiguous or shifting contexts.
- Mentor “catalysts” who can spread resilience and alignment throughout the organization.

#### Aim 4 — Reach and Equip People Who Seek Better Ways of Working

_Outcome:_ Ideas and frameworks resonate with ready learners who carry them into their own contexts.

_Tactics:_

- Host “Thinking Time” sparring sessions for open-ended exploration.
- Publish short essays or notes distilling mental models and practical tools.
- Invest selectively in communities with high resonance and multiplier potential.

<a id="daily-focus-example"></a>
### Daily Focus Snapshot (Example)
- **Morning (3–5 min):** Review aims (Aim 1–3), note 1–3 tasks you’ll approach differently to advance an aim.
  _Example:_ “In the design review, ask one question that tests alignment to Aim 2 (leverage through tech).”
- **Evening (3–5 min):** Capture 1 win, 1 learning, 1 adjustment for tomorrow.
  _Example:_ “Win: Stakeholders agreed to pilot the small ritual. Learning: we need clearer success criteria. Adjustment: draft the criteria first thing tomorrow (ties to Aim 3).”

<a id="weekly-review-example"></a>
### Weekly Review Example (Outcome‑linked)

- Pick 3–5 tasks tied explicitly to one or more Aims (label them Aim 1–4).
- [Aim 1] Ship a 1‑day prototype that tests a behavior‑change hypothesis; define success criteria up front.
- [Aim 2] Add a 15‑minute alignment ritual to a standing meeting; capture one decision and one learn.
- [Aim 3] Host one 30‑minute “Thinking Time” chat; publish one 300‑word note that emerged from it.
- [Aim 4] Block two hours for reflection/care; identify one work choice that increases margin next week.
