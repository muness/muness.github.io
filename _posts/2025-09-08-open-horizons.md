## What is this?

> *“The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.”* — Stephen Covey
> *“In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.”* — Albert Einstein

Open Horizons is a personal growth framework designed to help you clarify your direction, nurture your strengths, and maintain momentum. It’s a flexible, principle-driven approach that adapts to your unique context and evolves with you.

## Principles

Principles provide the foundation, but rituals turn them into daily practice. Rituals are small, repeatable actions that embed principles into your life. They help you stay aligned, adapt to change, and build habits that support your growth journey.

1. **Aim With Clarity**
   Define what success means to you. Clarity in your aims helps you make better decisions, focus your energy, and measure progress meaningfully. Without clear aims, effort can scatter and motivation wane.
2. **Nurture a Growth Mindset**
   Embrace learning and development as ongoing processes. Recognize strengths and weaknesses without judgment and see challenges as opportunities to grow rather than threats.
3. **Planning Over Plans**
   Prioritize adaptability and momentum over rigid adherence to plans. Use planning as a tool to guide your actions, not as a constraint that stifles responsiveness or creativity.
4. **Keep Momentum Alive**
   Regular reflection, celebration of wins, and adjustment keep your growth dynamic and sustainable. Momentum fuels motivation and helps you overcome obstacles.
5. **Leverage Strengths**
   Build on what energizes and empowers you. While growth areas are important, your strengths are your foundation for success and resilience.

> *“It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.”* — Charles Darwin

Starting Open Horizons may feel like a significant commitment. The initial run-through of these activities usually takes 4–6 weeks as you build habits and understanding. A practical approach is to focus on one activity per week, allowing each ritual to embed naturally before adding the next.

### 1. Reflect on Achievements

Reflection on your achievements serves as an essential anchor in your growth journey. By regularly reviewing what you have accomplished and the impact you have made, you reinforce your sense of progress and build confidence. This ritual helps you stay grounded in reality, ensuring that your aims remain connected to tangible outcomes and meaningful success.

#### What

Reflecting on achievements involves reviewing your significant accomplishments and the impact they have created. This ritual helps anchor your growth journey in tangible results and real-world outcomes.

#### Why

It grounds your personal growth in reality, boosting confidence and providing a clear foundation for setting future aims with clarity.

#### Criteria

- Identify three significant accomplishments from recent years.
- Focus on impact, not just tasks completed.
- Use evidence like performance notes, resumes, or LinkedIn profiles.

#### Tips

- Review impact/performance notes and your resume/LinkedIn.
- Share your list with a peer or mentor for perspective.
- Maintain a simple “wins” log to make future reflections easier.

#### If this doesn't work

Try alternative reflection methods like informal conversations, visual timelines, or storytelling to capture your impact in ways that feel natural to you.

### 2. Recognize Strengths

Understanding and leveraging your strengths is vital for sustainable growth. This ritual encourages you to identify the qualities and skills that energize you, enabling you to focus your efforts where you are most effective. Recognizing strengths not only builds confidence but also helps you approach challenges with resilience and a positive mindset.

#### What

### 3. Affirm Your Mission

This ritual invites you to articulate your core purpose and guiding principles, serving as a compass that aligns your efforts and decisions.

### 4. Aim & Set Priorities

Setting clear and focused priorities is crucial for maintaining momentum and direction. This ritual guides you to define a limited number of growth areas that challenge you and align with your mission. By concentrating your efforts, you can make meaningful progress without becoming overwhelmed.

#### What

Define no more than three key growth areas each quarter that stretch you and align with your mission.

#### Why

Focused aims help maintain momentum and prevent overwhelm.

### 5. Weekly Review

Regularly reviewing your weekly progress keeps your growth aligned and adaptable. This ritual helps break down priorities into manageable tasks, allowing you to adjust plans as needed and maintain steady momentum. Weekly reviews foster accountability and ensure you stay connected to your broader aims.

## Credits

This framework was inspired and informed by the works and teachings of:

- [The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins) by Michael D. Watkins. This helped me understand the importance of the first 90 days in a new role, and success through a learning mindset. After my coach helped me apply these ideas to be successful in new roles, I got the idea of making this a rolling 90-day plan that supports my growth.
- [Stategy and Tactics](https://goldrattresearchlabs.com/pdf/other-authors/_Strategy_and_Tactics__-_by_Eli_Goldratt,_Rami_Gol.PDF) by Eli Goldratt, Rami Goldratt and Eli Abramov. While it may be obvious to all of you, the idea of a hierarchy of strategy and tactic (and strategy and tactic nested under them) was a revelation to me. I've used this idea to help me think about my priorities and how they relate to my mission.
- [The Path Between The Seas](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Path-Between-the-Seas/David-McCullough/9780743262132) by David McCullough. This book helped me understand that we can in fact emark on projects that we have no idea how to complete. We can learn and discover as we go.
- [Outcomes over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes) by Joshua Seiden. It's not about the output, it's about the outcomes we achieve. So a planning system that focuses on outcomes and pushes out plans until the last minute makes sense and is worth bragging about.
- The Working Genius [book](https://www.workinggenius.com/) and [podcast](https://workinggeniuspodcast.libsyn.com/) by Patrick Lencioni. This helped me understand that we each have strengths, and we should leverage them and not lament all the weaknesses we have. He also helped me not feel guilty about my habit of [asking people why they're doing things](https://www.tablegroup.com/88-the-power-of-daily-disruption/) and urging them to reconsider whether what they're doing is the best way to meet their goals.
- Glenn Vanderburg’s paper [Extreme Programming Annealed](https://vanderburg.org/writing/xpannealed.pdf) sharpened my understanding of reinforcing processes. He showed that healthy systems rely on nested feedback loops at multiple scales, and that if you remove a practice, you must replace it with something that provides feedback at the same level. That framing deeply influenced how I think about Open Horizons.
- My coach, Daphne who helps me embrace a growth mindset and apply it to my whole life.
- The dozens of friends, people I've mentored and teammates who've tried past versions of the framework and helped me make it better.
- Many thanks to Jason Rudolph, Jay Floyd and Ale Cabrera for reading drafts of this and providing feedback that made it much better.

### Testimonials

Ale Cabrera:
> My imposter syndrome hasn't fully gone away, but we’re at peace now. When I start having the familiar feelings, I just look at my doc and I feel relieved. It works for me.

Jason Rudolph:
> Most growth systems seem to assume that your path should be determined by your strengths, or by the company's needs, or by the intersection of the two. For me, that's always resulted in a plan I've found uninspiring.
> Muness's system reveals the missing components: I needed to identify what motivates me, the growth endeavors that I'm most proud of, and the accomplishments of the people that I look up to. The result: A plan that truly inspires me and has guided me toward fulfilling growth for more than a year now.

## Embracing the Journey

Personal growth is not a destination but a continuous journey filled with reflection, adaptation, and discovery. Open Horizons invites you to revisit your aims regularly, nurture your strengths, and keep momentum through intentional rituals. As Confucius said, *“It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.”* Embrace the process with patience and curiosity, and find joy in the unfolding path of continuous learning and improvement.
