## What is this?

This is an adaptive framework I’ve developed and refined over the years to guide personal and professional growth. At its core, it’s about **clarity of direction, meaningful action, and continuous learning**.

Dwight D. Eisenhower once said:

> “Plans are nothing; planning is everything.”

That’s the spirit of **Open Horizons**. We can’t predict every twist in the road, but we can **aim with intent**, **do what matters**, and **reflect often enough to adapt**. Over time, this rhythm builds clarity, momentum, and resilience.

---

## Principles

Rituals without principles become empty motions. To avoid cargo-culting, **Open Horizons** starts with principles — the *why* behind every practice.

### Aim With Clarity

Progress depends on two things: knowing where you’re headed and choosing the right steps to get there. Busywork and misdirected effort can look productive in the moment but stall long-term growth. Aim with clarity means defining what matters most, then channeling energy into the actions with the greatest impact.

### Be Kind, Not Nice

Niceness avoids discomfort. Kindness invites growth. Niceness lets someone stumble in silence; kindness means delivering honest, empathetic feedback even when it’s awkward. Teams and individuals thrive in environments of trust, and trust comes from candor paired with care.

### Nurture a Growth Mindset

Every setback is raw material for progress. Growth doesn’t come from avoiding difficulty, but from leaning into reflection and iteration. Antifragility means that challenges strengthen you rather than deplete you.

### Recover Quickly

Plans will falter. That’s not a problem — it’s expected. The danger isn’t falling, it’s staying down. Quick recovery means testing, learning, and adjusting before the cost compounds. It values momentum and adaptability over pride and perfection.

### Planning Over Plans

A plan is a guess. Planning is the discipline of orienting, choosing, and re-choosing as conditions shift. Circumstances will make any specific plan obsolete, but the practice of planning will make you resilient.

## From Principles to Rituals

Principles explain the intent. Rituals carry them forward. Each ritual below is *one way* to live the principles. If a ritual doesn’t fit your context, adapt it — **but don’t lose the principle**.

### 1. Reflect on Achievements (*Aim With Clarity*)

List three things you’re most proud of from the last few years. Not just tasks, but their impact: increased revenue, improved user experience, stronger trust, new capabilities. This grounds your direction in reality.

**Tips**

- Review impact/performance notes and your resume/LinkedIn.
- Share your list with a peer or mentor for perspective.
- Keep a simple “wins” log to make future iterations easier.

---

### 2. Recognize Strengths (*Nurture a Growth Mindset*)

From those achievements, identify the strengths that made them possible. Ask for feedback. Notice where you felt energized. These are the levers you should lean on.

**Tips**

- Request feedback from peers and managers.
- Use tools (e.g., Working Genius, StrengthsFinder) as inputs, not verdicts.

---

### 3. Affirm Your Mission (*Aim With Clarity*)

Write down what motivates you — a personal mission statement. This becomes your compass and helps filter what deserves your energy.

**Criteria**

- Do you see it reflected in past achievements?
- Do your strengths align with it?
- Does it energize you for the long run?

---

### 4. Aim & Set Priorities (*Planning Over Plans*)

Each quarter, define your growth areas — no more than three. These aren’t titles or tasks, but enduring skills, experiences, or relationships.

**Criteria**

- **Hard:** Worth stretching for.
- **Important:** Direct line to your mission.
- **Viable:** Leverages strengths, relevant to work, support available.
- **Few:** Pick the three that matter most.

**Tips**

- What would make past wins even stronger?
- What future achievement do you want to be able to claim?
- Pressure test with peers.

---

### 5. Weekly Review (*Recover Quickly*)

Each week, break your quarterly priorities into 3–5 concrete, achievable tasks.

**Criteria**

- **Important:** Directly tied to a priority.
- **Viable:** Can be done this week, without dependencies.
- **Realistic:** Fits your other commitments.

**Prompts**

- What’s the one most important step this week?
- What did I learn last week that changes the plan?
- What should I stop doing?

---

### 6. Daily Focus (*Keep Momentum Alive*)

A short, repeatable ritual to connect your day’s work with your longer-term aims.

**Morning (5 minutes)**

1. Print or open your current Aims — keep them visible.
2. Jot down today’s meetings and tasks.
3. Ask: *How can I approach these in a way that furthers my Aims?*
4. Recall your strengths — which ones will you lean on today?

**Evening (5 minutes)**

1. Reflect on the day. Where did you make progress?
2. Capture wins and insights; prep anything needed for tomorrow.

## Credits and Testimonials

**Credits**

- [The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins) by Michael D. Watkins. This helped me understand the importance of the first 90 days in a new role, and success through a learning mindset. After my coach helped me apply these ideas to be successful in new roles, I got the idea of making this a rolling 90-day plan that supports my growth.
- [Stategy and Tactics](https://goldrattresearchlabs.com/pdf/other-authors/_Strategy_and_Tactics__-_by_Eli_Goldratt,_Rami_Gol.PDF) by Eli Goldratt, Rami Goldratt and Eli Abramov. While it may be obvious to all of you, the idea of a hierarchy of strategy and tactic (and strategy and tactic nested under them) was a revelation to me. I've used this idea to help me think about my priorities and how they relate to my mission.
- [The Path Between The Seas](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Path-Between-the-Seas/David-McCullough/9780743262132) by David McCullough. This book helped me understand that we can in fact emark on projects that we have no idea how to complete. We can learn and discover as we go.
- [Outcomes over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes) by Joshua Seiden. It's not about the output, it's about the outcomes we achieve. So a planning system that focuses on outcomes and pushes out plans until the last minute makes sense and is worth bragging about.
- The Working Genius [book](https://www.workinggenius.com/) and [podcast](https://workinggeniuspodcast.libsyn.com/) by Patrick Lencioni. This helped me understand that we each have strengths, and we should leverage them and not lament all the weaknesses we have. He also helped me not feel guilty about my habit of [asking people why they're doing things](https://www.tablegroup.com/88-the-power-of-daily-disruption/) and urging them to reconsider whether what they're doing is the best way to meet their goals.
- My coach, Daphne who helps me embrace a growth mindset and apply it to my whole life.
- The dozens of friends, people I've mentored and teammates who've tried past versions of the framework and helped me make it better.
- Many thanks to Jason Rudolph, Jay Floyd and Ale Cabrera for reading drafts of this and providing feedback that made it much better.

## Embracing the Journey

The power of **Open Horizons** isn’t in reaching a fixed destination, but in practicing the rhythm:

**Aim. Do. Reflect.**

By aiming with intent, acting with focus, and reflecting often, you cultivate clarity and adaptability. That’s how growth compounds — not by clinging to rigid plans, but by moving with purpose across open horizons.

## Previous versions

I've iterated on this framework over the years. It used to be called 90-day plans, Rolling Plans amongst others. This is the latest version as of 2025.
