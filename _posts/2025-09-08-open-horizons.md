## What is this?

> *“The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.”* — Stephen Covey

Open Horizons is a personal growth framework designed to help you clarify your direction, nurture your strengths, and maintain momentum. It’s a flexible, principle-driven approach that adapts to your unique context and evolves with you.

## Principles

Principles provide the foundation, but rituals turn them into daily practice. Rituals are small, repeatable actions that embed principles into your life. They help you stay aligned, adapt to change, and build habits that support your growth journey.

1. **Aim With Clarity**
   Define what success means to you. Clarity in your aims helps you make better decisions, focus your energy, and measure progress meaningfully. Without clear aims, effort can scatter and motivation wane.

2. **Nurture a Growth Mindset**
   Embrace learning and development as ongoing processes. Recognize strengths and weaknesses without judgment and see challenges as opportunities to grow rather than threats.

3. **Planning Over Plans**
   Prioritize adaptability and momentum over rigid adherence to plans. Use planning as a tool to guide your actions, not as a constraint that stifles responsiveness or creativity.

4. **Keep Momentum Alive**
   Regular reflection, celebration of wins, and adjustment keep your growth dynamic and sustainable. Momentum fuels motivation and helps you overcome obstacles.

5. **Leverage Strengths**
   Build on what energizes and empowers you. While growth areas are important, your strengths are your foundation for success and resilience.

### 1. Reflect on Achievements

Reflecting on your achievements is essential because it grounds your personal growth journey in tangible results and meaningful impact. It helps you see where your efforts have led to real change, providing a foundation for setting future aims with clarity and confidence. To do this effectively, take time to list three significant accomplishments from the past few years. Focus not only on the tasks completed but also on the impact they created—whether it’s increased revenue, enhanced user experience, stronger relationships, or new capabilities developed. This reflection anchors your direction in reality and helps you appreciate your progress.

To carry out this ritual, review your performance notes, resumes, or LinkedIn profile for evidence of achievements. Share your list with a trusted peer or mentor to gain perspective and validation. Maintaining a simple “wins” log can make future reflections easier and more insightful.

#### Tips

- Review impact/performance notes and your resume/LinkedIn.
- Share your list with a peer or mentor for perspective.
- Keep a simple “wins” log to make future iterations easier.

#### If this doesn't work

Try alternative reflection methods like informal conversations, visual timelines, or storytelling to capture your impact in ways that feel natural to you.


### 2. Recognize Strengths

Recognizing your strengths is vital because it allows you to build upon what energizes and empowers you, making growth more sustainable and effective. This ritual involves identifying the personal qualities, skills, and behaviors that contributed to your achievements. Pay attention to moments when you felt energized or confident, and seek feedback from peers and managers to gain external insights. Using tools like Working Genius or StrengthsFinder can supplement your understanding, but remember to treat them as inputs rather than definitive labels.

To practice this ritual, compile feedback, reflect on your experiences, and note strengths that consistently appear. This awareness helps you leverage your unique assets as you pursue new goals.

#### Tips

- Request feedback from peers and managers.
- Use tools (e.g., Working Genius, StrengthsFinder) as inputs, not verdicts.

#### If this doesn't work

Consider journaling your experiences or having informal peer conversations to uncover strengths in a way that fits your style.


### 3. Affirm Your Mission

Affirming your mission is a powerful way to stay motivated and focused by clearly articulating what drives you. This ritual asks you to write a personal mission statement that captures your core purpose and serves as a compass for decision-making. It helps filter out distractions and aligns your energy with what truly matters.

To do this, reflect on your past achievements and strengths to ensure your mission resonates authentically. Ask yourself if it energizes you for the long term and aligns with your values. Keep your mission visible and revisit it regularly to maintain clarity.

#### Criteria

- Do you see it reflected in past achievements?
- Do your strengths align with it?
- Does it energize you for the long run?

#### If this doesn't work

Express your mission through conversations, visual boards, or by identifying core values that resonate deeply to keep your purpose clear.


### 4. Aim & Set Priorities

Setting clear aims and priorities is critical for focused growth. This ritual involves defining no more than three growth areas each quarter that represent enduring skills, experiences, or relationships you want to develop. These aims should stretch you, be important to your mission, and leverage your strengths while being realistically achievable with available support.

To implement this, reflect on what would amplify your past successes and what future achievements you aspire to. Discuss your priorities with peers to test their relevance and feasibility. This focused approach helps maintain momentum without overwhelming you.

#### Criteria

- **Hard:** Worth stretching for.
- **Important:** Direct line to your mission.
- **Viable:** Leverages strengths, relevant to work, support available.
- **Few:** Pick the three that matter most.

#### Tips

- What would make past wins even stronger?
- What future achievement do you want to be able to claim?
- Pressure test with peers.

#### If this doesn't work

Try shorter cycles, flexible themes, or evolving focus areas to keep intentionality without rigidity.


### 5. Weekly Review

The weekly review ritual keeps your momentum alive by breaking down quarterly priorities into manageable, actionable tasks. It ensures that your work remains aligned with your aims and adapts to new insights or changes. Each week, identify 3–5 concrete tasks that are important, viable within the week, and realistic considering your other commitments.

To do this, reflect on what the most impactful step is for the week, lessons learned from the previous week, and what activities might be paused or stopped. This practice fosters regular reflection, learning, and course correction.

#### Criteria

- **Important:** Directly tied to a priority.
- **Viable:** Can be done this week, without dependencies.
- **Realistic:** Fits your other commitments.

#### Prompts

- What’s the one most important step this week?
- What did I learn last week that changes the plan?
- What should I stop doing?

#### If this doesn't work

Use informal check-ins, quick daily scans, or collaborative planning sessions to maintain regular progress reviews.


### 6. Daily Focus

Daily focus rituals help connect your everyday work to your longer-term aims, sustaining momentum and motivation. This involves a brief morning and evening routine to plan and reflect on your day in alignment with your goals and strengths.

In the morning (about 5 minutes), review your current aims visibly, list your meetings and tasks, and ask how you can approach them to advance your aims. Recall your strengths and consider how to leverage them throughout the day.

In the evening (about 5 minutes), reflect on where you made progress, capture wins and insights, and prepare for the next day. This routine keeps your efforts intentional and connected to your broader growth.

**Morning (5 minutes)**

1. Print or open your current Aims — keep them visible.
2. Jot down today’s meetings and tasks.
3. Ask: *How can I approach these in a way that furthers my Aims?*
4. Recall your strengths — which ones will you lean on today?

**Evening (5 minutes)**

1. Reflect on the day. Where did you make progress?
2. Capture wins and insights; prep anything needed for tomorrow.

#### If this doesn't work

Try micro-reflections, mindfulness breaks, or integrating reflection into existing routines like commutes or pauses.
