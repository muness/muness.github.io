Those of you who've found value in my last couple of bash specific posts may also like the <a href="http://github.com/relevance/etc/tree/master/bash/project_aliases.sh">latest addition</a> to my <code>~/.bash_profile</code>.
<p>
This one iterates through the one or more directories and creates aliases to the subdirectories so I don't have to.  Here's the scenario: I've got a directory ~/work/ where I keep work projects, a ~/writings/ where I keep all the writing projects and so on.  I used to have aliases to each subdirectory.  e.g. <code>alias project1="cd /Users/muness/work/project1"</code>.  With shame, I admit that I maintained each of these manually.  No more!</p>
<p>
Install instructions:
<code>
<pre>
curl -L http://github.com/relevance/etc/tree/master%2Fbash%2Fproject_aliases.sh?raw=true?raw=true > ~/.project_aliases.sh
echo "source ~/. project_aliases.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
Usage instructions:
<ul>
<li>Move your work projects to <code>~/work</code>.</li>
<li>Above the <code>source ~/. project_aliases.sh</code> add <code>PROJECT_PARENT_DIRS[0]="$HOME/work"</code>.
</ul>
