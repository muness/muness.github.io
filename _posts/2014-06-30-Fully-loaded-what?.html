Over my years as a hiring manager I've found that I really like working with contractors. Some of the reasons are what you'd expect: it's nice to work together on a temporary basis on things we both find explicitly and mutually beneficial, the contractors I work with are usually experts on the things I hire them for and can hit the ground running.<br />
<br />
One operational benefit that I didn't value until recently was the clarity of their hourly rate: when you work with a contractor, you specifically agree on an hourly rate with them. At least in the US, that kind of cost clarity is non-existent for employees.<br />
<br />
Especially in the context of professional services, where you're selling someone's time, knowing someone's hourly cost can is quite relevant in setting the price of their services. In that vein, I've seen people use a rule of thumb to approximate hourly cost: divide their annual salary by 2000. For example, for someone making $120,000, the rule of thumb would say the equivalent hourly cost is $60.<br />
<br />
This rule of thumb is utterly wrong. The first page of results for a Google search on calculating the "fully loaded cost" of an employee has a telling example. <a href="http://research.unc.edu/offices/sponsored-research/policies-procedures/section-300/policy-7/procedure-5/">UNC Research provides a formula</a> to help those submitting budget proposals calculate fully loaded hourly salaries. And the example they use is telling: for a full time EPA employee with a $150,000 in salary, their formula comes up with a very different $157.36/hr rate. Remember, the naive rule of thumb I see used all the time would result in an hourly rate of only $75/hr.<br />
<br />
Where does this difference come from? As a sometimes hiring manager, what rate should I use when I am thinking through the difference in cost from hiring an employee or a contractor? I really wasn't sure. And many fellow hiring managers weren't sure either. So I came up with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xncCxeKsmEfgUDZpyTHE8le9SUn0m0RvoOWqBdLEF1Q/edit#gid=826308895">a model</a> to help me think through the costs.<br />
<br />
Before I go any further, I'd like to remind you of the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box">quote</a>: "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful." <b>This model is wrong</b>. Every business will incur different costs for benefits. You'll have different time off policies. It's a model that I've used to estimate employees' fully loaded cost. If it seems generous, that is because I've been lucky to have been working in tech where the benefits are incredible. But I find it useful, and think you will too.<br />
<br />
The model is based on a few assumptions:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>US based.</li>
<li>2014 <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/RatesLimits2014.html">FICA rates</a>.</li>
<li>Paid time off is based on <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ebs.t05.htm">BLS 1996 averages</a>&nbsp;and updated based on my personal experience.</li>
<li>401(k), state unemployment insurance costs and health care insurance based on a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/28/smallbusiness/salary-benefits/">2013 CNN Money article</a> and updated based on my personal experience.</li>
<li>No <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/09/12-startups-that-offer-their-employees-the-coolest-perks/">superawesome</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-wants-to-work-at-tech-companies-2013-1">mega</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://bendyworks.com/growth-day-happenings-friday-the-13th/">wowza</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/10/17/google-facebook-twitter-linkedin-perks-infographic/">perks</a>&nbsp;such as lunch, massages, car washes. Instead I've only &nbsp;included&nbsp;the "normal" ones I've come to expect including a conference budget and a new laptops every couple of years.</li>
<li>No other indirect costs like rent.</li>
<li>I factored in a utilization rate (85%) to reflect the fact that even for a billable person, not every hour of the day will go towards billing. Things that I have seen taking up time of delivery personnel include travel, context switch time, internal meetings, reporting hours and expenses and sales support. I expect that even in a product company you'll have time lost to these sorts of things, though the utilization rate may be higher.</li>
</ul><div>With the model a $150,000 full time salaried employee will cost approximately $181,000 a year. With an expected 1530 utilized hours, that works out to $118/hr.</div><div><br />
</div><div>If you're curious about your own fully loaded costs, make a copy of the model and tweak away.<br />
