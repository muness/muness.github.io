<strong>Note</strong>: I've forked this notifier to add features and fix some bugs at in <a href=http://muness.blogspot.com/2008/03/where-theres-smoke-signals.html>Smoke Signals</a>.

At Relevance, we make heavy use of Campfire for our distributed projects.  One room per project, and we expect everyone to "be in" the relevant room associated with the project they're working on at the time.  We use it to communicate: to ask for a pair (we've tried Leopard's Remote Desktop Sharing, but have no settled mostly on emacs + screen), ask questions, request code reviews (we've taken to using the topic for posting ad hoc requests like that), and make announcements.

<p>
This virtual space has many disadvantages over being in the same room as I'd been used to on my previous couple of projects, but it did have a nice perk: SVN commit notifications were right there alongside our own discussions.  The notices were more useful than I expected, a quick, clear indicator of our pace on a given day.

<p>
Naturally, I wanted our other major automated task to notify us of 
<A HREF=http://ccmenu.sourceforge.net/>CCMenu</A> is OK, but it's disconnected from our primary virtual space (Campfire, as discussed above).  Being <a href=http://undefined.com/ia/2006/10/24/the-fourteen-types-of-programmers-type-4-lazy-ones/>lazy</a>, I didn't want to build it myself, so I first looked around for tools that suited my needs.  Much to my chagrin, none did, so I took the one that was closest and added to it what I needed: <a href=http://campfire-ccrb.rubyforge.org/svn/test/campfire_notifier_test.rb>specs</a>.  Then came the stuff that was missing: ssl support and support for one room per project.  And last but not least, to help deal with configuration hassles and debugging, I added logging.

<p>
If you're using CruiseControl.rb and Campfire, give it a whirl.  Instructions are in the <a href=http://campfire-ccrb.rubyforge.org/svn/CampfireNotifier.README>README</A>.
