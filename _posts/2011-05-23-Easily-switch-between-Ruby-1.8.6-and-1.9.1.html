<strong>NOTE: I don't keep Ruby Switcher updated anymore.  Use <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a> instead.</strong>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://spicycode.com/">Chad</a> mentioned that he'd gotten ruby 1.9.1 and 1.8.6 side by side on his workstation (his <a href="http://github.com/spicycode/spicy-config/commit/aa264bb6e809af6f669a3678dc1f13c6579732a7">code</a> for this is in his awesome spicy-config repo).
</p>
<p>
I took some time this morning to get a <a href="http://github.com/relevance/etc/blob/c0f4ad613c208eb80a239e1c986ecc9e29aa1d9e/bash/ruby_switcher.sh">similar setup</a> working.  Now, on my prompt, I type, <code>use_ruby_186</code> or <code>use_ruby_191</code> to go back and forth between the Ruby 1.8.6 shipped with Leopard and a self-compiled install of ruby 1.9.1.
</p>
<p>Steps for you to get there:
<ol>
<li>Compile and install ruby 1.9.1:
<code>
<pre>
mkdir -p ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp
curl -O ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-p0.tar.gz
tar xzf ruby-1.9.1-p0.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.9.1-p0
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.ruby_versions/ruby_191
make
make install
</pre>
</code>
</li>
<li>Install the ruby switcher:
<code>
<pre>
curl -L http://github.com/relevance/etc/tree/master%2Fbash%2Fruby_switcher.sh?raw=true?raw=true > ~/ruby_switcher.sh
echo "source ~/ruby_switcher.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
</pre>
</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that I use ~/.gem for my gems.  If you don't do that, you'll have to modify the switcher to specify your <code>GEM_HOME</code>.  Type <code>gem env</code> and look for GEM PATHS to figure out what you should set it to.
