After you copy an Ubuntu (or any Debian based) image, you'll probably lose your network connectivity.  After a little bit of <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/message/521604#521604">digging</a>, it turns out that udev persists the MAC address of the network device in <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/*net.rules</code> .  The fix: <pre><code>sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/*net.rules</code>
  <code>sudo shutdown -r now #to reboot</code>
</pre></p>
