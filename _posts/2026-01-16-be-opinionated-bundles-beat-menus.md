title: "Be Opinionated: Bundles Beat Menus"
toc: true
hidden: true
excerpt: "When the path isn’t well-worn, choice is friction. A coherent, opinionated bundle beats a composable menu for most people—especially in AI workflows."

## Hook (2–3 sentences)

Builders love composability. Users love outcomes. When people are still learning what’s possible, a menu of plugins and knobs is not empowerment—it’s cognitive tax.

## Outline

### 1) The False Virtue of Composability

- “Let them choose” is a way to avoid responsibility for coherence.
- Composition helps experts; it blocks novices.

### 2) Why AI Workflows Magnify This

- The system is already probabilistic; the human needs stable rails.
- Every additional choice is another way to start wrong and thrash faster.

### 3) The Bundle Principle

- Ship one default path that works end-to-end.
- Make escape hatches explicit (overrides), not implicit (mystery configuration).

### 4) The Adoption Path

- Bundle first.
- Instrument friction.
- Extract common variants.
- Only then expose composition.

### 5) What “Opinionated” Means (Without Becoming Dogmatic)

- Defaults are strong.
- Overrides are logged.
- Learning is preserved.
