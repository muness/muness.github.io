One of the things we preach as software developers is <a href=http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html>release early, release often</a>.  I think ESR is right in that our primary motivation for this is often related to quality:
<blockquote>
In the bazaar view, on the other hand, you assume that bugs are generally shallow phenomenaâ€”or, at least, that they turn shallow pretty quickly when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers pounding on every single new release. <strong>Accordingly you release often in order to get more corrections</strong>, and as a beneficial side effect you have less to lose if an occasional botch gets out the door.
</blockquote>

As I've done more project consulting and management, I've realized that the benefits extend well beyond the technical ones.  But I've had a difficult time articulating the business benefits to incremental, frequent releases.  

<p>Last week, Ross posted an article that describes one of the primary business benefits to frequent, early releases, <a href=http://agilemanager.blogspot.com/2008/02/minimising-speculative-risk-of-it.html>Minimising the Speculative Risk of IT Investments</a>:
<blockquote>
With each incremental delivery, and every increase in tangible value, the intangible or speculative value decreases. <strong>The reduction in speculative value at risk represents a reduction in the total value that can be depressed through delays in delivery</strong>. Thus, early delivery reduces the risk of speculative value not being realised. Simultaneously, it reduces the volatility of returns.
</blockquote>
<p>What other benefits do you find to the business from releasing early, releasing often?
