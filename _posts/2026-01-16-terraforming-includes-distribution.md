title: "Terraforming Includes Distribution"
toc: true
hidden: true
excerpt: "It’s not enough to build faster. If you can’t get the work into the world, you’re optimizing inside a closed loop. Distribution becomes a binding constraint—and terraforming means reshaping that too."

## Hook (2–3 sentences)

In a world where generation is cheap, the scarce thing is reality: adoption, deployment, and the channel that carries your work to users. That means “distribution” stops being a marketing afterthought and becomes part of the system design.

## Outline

### 1) The New Economic Split

- Generation: cheap
- Verification: expensive
- Distribution: binding

### 2) Distribution as a Constraint

- If you can’t ship into a channel, you can’t learn.
- If you can’t learn, you can’t compound.

### 3) Terraform the Channel, Not Just the Product

- Make installation trivial.
- Make sharing native.
- Make feedback loops visible.

### 4) The Hidden Advantage

- Incumbents often own the obvious channel and still fail to use it.
- Small teams can out-iterate if they control a tight feedback loop.

### 5) Tie Back to Grounded Execution

- Distribution without guardrails creates blast radius.
- Guardrails without distribution creates stagnation.
