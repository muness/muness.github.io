## What is this?

This is a comprehensive, adaptive framework I've developed and refined over the years to guide personal and professional growth. At its core, the methodology is anchored in the principle of **acting with intent**. By examining my history, understanding my strengths, and setting forth a clear mission, I can aim with precision and confidence.

Military strategist and President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said,
> "Plans are nothing; planning is everything."

This encapsulates the essence of my approach. While static plans can become obsolete in the face of rapidly changing circumstances, the act of planning equips us with the flexibility, insight, and resilience to adapt and pivot as needed. The framework isn't about meticulously crafted plans set in stone; it's about cultivating a mindset of preparation, agility, and continuous learning.

Several criteria came up as I've iterated over this framework:

- **Clarity of Direction:**
  > "If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there." – Lewis Carroll

  It's imperative to have clear priorities and understand the rationale behind them.
- **Reality-Check:**
  > "Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." – Winston Churchill

  Grounding our objectives in past achievements ensures they're rooted in reality and builds on proven strengths.
- **Proactive:**
  > "The future depends on what you do today." – Mahatma Gandhi

  The world is full of distractions and external demands. This framework ensures we don't become passive recipients of life's agenda but active directors of our destiny.

- **Adaptive:**
  > "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change." – Charles Darwin

  Life's only constant is change. A robust system needs to be easy to update, reflecting evolving goals and circumstances.

- **Quick Recovery:**
  > "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." – Confucius

  By focusing on short, 90-day sprints, this approach fosters a "fail fast, learn faster" attitude. If a certain direction proves unfruitful, little time is wasted, and course corrections can be made swiftly.

While the specifics evolve, the process of planning, with its introspection, foresight, and adaptability guide me.

1. **Reflect on Achievements:** Document your proudest professional moments. Think of how they made a difference in terms of revenue, user experience, or other tangible impacts.
2. **Recognize Your Strengths:** Examine your achievements and discern the skills that helped you accomplish them. Tools like the Enneagram or Working Genius can provide insights.
3. **Affirm Your Mission:** Create a personal mission statement. Think about what you want to be remembered for.
4. **Set Priorities:** Combining the “Aim” and “Identify small wins” steps, list your growth areas for the next quarter. Ensure that these align with your mission, leverage your strengths, and can be realistically achieved in three months. These priorities will be your focus areas, guiding your efforts for the next 90 days.
5. **Weekly Priorities Review:** Each week, review your set priorities and adjust based on current circumstances, opportunities, or challenges. Look for ways to leverage your unique strengths and the current situation to progress towards your quarterly outcomes.

When you first implement this system, the investment level is high. Aim to do one to two activities a week. And once you've tried it a couple of times, make it your own.

### 1. Reflect on Achievements

Before setting future goals, it's crucial to recognize and celebrate past successes. Reflecting on achievements provides motivation and a clear understanding of capabilities.

**Tips:**

- Maintain a weekly or even daily log of your accomplishments. I capture feedback and wins in my daily digital journal so I can search for them later.
- Don't just list tasks completed; note the impact they had.
- Share your accomplishments with a mentor or colleague to gain perspective.

### 2. Know Your Strengths

Recognizing your strengths gives you an edge. It enables you to play to your advantages, making tasks more effortless and impactful.

**Tips:**

- Request feedback from peers and supervisors.
- Reflect on the tasks you found most engaging and fulfilling.
- Consider using psychometric tests. Don't just take the results at face value; reflect on them and discuss them with others and make your own conclusions about your strengths.

### 3. Aim

Your mission or aim provides direction. It's the compass guiding your tasks, goals, and ambitions.

**Tips:**

- Visualize where you want to be in 3-5 years.
- Determine the skills and knowledge you need to acquire to get there.
- Revisit and refine your aim periodically.

### 4. How Do I Use 90-Day Priorities?

90-day priorities aren't just a list of tasks. They’re a structured approach to growth, aligning daily tasks with longer-term goals and aspirations.

**Tips:**

- Every week, break down your priorities into actionable tasks. Consider: what is the one most important thing I can do this week to move towards this priority?
- Review your priorities regularly.
- Adjust as needed based on progress and changing circumstances.

## Example Worksheet: Joining TechCorp

To better illustrate the application of this system, here's an example from my recent experience joining a new company.

    - No Room for Blame: Mistakes happen. Instead of pointing fingers, our focus should be on understanding, learning, and growing from them.

- **Per the Working Genius: Wonder & Discernment**
  - Wonder: "asking the questions that provoke answers and action ... wondering whether things shouldn’t be different or whether there is untapped potential that should be tapped"
  - Discernment: "ability to assess an idea or situation ... provide advice and feedback"

## Embracing the Journey

Reflecting on the last few years, I've come to realize that while goals seem appealing, it's the journey — intentional planning, adaptability, and continuous learning — that has unleashed my growth and reinforced a growth mindset. This approach propelled me forward but also reinforced my growth mindset, teaching me to cherish the lessons, challenges, and guidance I get along the way.

But here's the beautiful part: this isn't just my story. The essence of this approach is universally applicable. While I've laid out my experiences and methods, the core principles can resonate with anyone, anywhere. It's not just about setting goals but the deliberation, the reflection, and the intentional steps we take towards them. It's about harnessing the power of focused intent, the beauty of adaptability, and the joy of continuous learning. I've used adaptations of the framework to plan teams, help friends get over existential crises and in my coaching.

Dive in, make it yours, and tell me about it. How did it work for you? Where did you tweak? I'd love to hear your stories!

## Credits and Testimonials

### Credits

- [The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins) by Michael D. Watkins. This helped me understand the importance of the first 90 days in a new role, and success through a learning mindset. After my coach helped me apply these ideas to be successful in new roles, I got the idea of making this a rolling 90-day plan that supports my growth.
- [Stategy and Tactics](https://goldrattresearchlabs.com/pdf/other-authors/_Strategy_and_Tactics__-_by_Eli_Goldratt,_Rami_Gol.PDF) by Eli Goldratt, Rami Goldratt and Eli Abramov. While it may be obvious to all of you, the idea of a hierarchy of strategy and tactic (and strategy and tactic nested under them) was a revelation to me. I've used this idea to help me think about my priorities and how they relate to my mission.
- [The Path Between The Seas](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Path-Between-the-Seas/David-McCullough/9780743262132) by David McCullough. This book helped me understand that we can in fact emark on projects that we have no idea how to complete. We can learn and discover as we go.
- [Outcomes over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes) by Joshua Seiden. It's not about the output, it's about the outcomes we achieve. So a planning system that focuses on outcomes and pushes out plans until the last minute makes sense and is worth bragging about.
- The Working Genius [book](https://www.workinggenius.com/) and [podcast](https://workinggeniuspodcast.libsyn.com/) by Patrick Lencioni. This helped me understand that we each have strengths, and we should leverage them and not lament all the weaknesses we have. He also helped me not feel guilty about my habit of [asking people why they're doing things](https://www.tablegroup.com/88-the-power-of-daily-disruption/) and urging them to reconsider whether what they're doing is the best way to meet their goals.
- My coach, Daphne who helps me embrace a growth mindset and apply it to my whole life.
- Many thanks to Jay Floyd and Ale Cabrera for reading drafts of this and providing feedback that made it much better.
