I am in a lot of meetings. I am also on IM much if not all the time. Despite all the hoopla around Google Hangouts, Google Calendar doesn't support hangout/google talk reminders.<br />
<br />
The chrome desktop notifications aren't quite what I need either: they don't give me a link straight into the hangout I am supposed to be in. Instead, when I click the link in them, it opens up Google calendar in the default week view, I have to scan to right now, find the meeting, click it and then click on the "Join hangout" link therein.<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks ago I got fed up with this and decided to hack something together to make life easier. I added hangout link support to gcalcli (<a href="https://github.com/muness/gcalcli">see my fork</a>), wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-gcalcli_parse_tsv">a script that parses the TSV output</a> finding the links I care about in events coming up in the next 10 minutes, and then wired it up with <a href="http://sendxmpp.hostname.sk/">sendxmpp </a>and cron <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-cal_im_reminder">to send me an IM</a> with the meeting title, start time and either a hangout link or a deep link to the event in google calendar.<br />
<br />
(While I was at it, I also put together a mini life hack: a <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-soon">script</a>&nbsp;that shows me all the events I have coming up in the next 4 hours.)<br />
<br />
If you too want to get your calendar reminders via IM:<br />
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/muness/gcalcli">my fork of gcalcli</a>&nbsp;(master branch)</li>
<li>Authorize gcalcli to your account by launching it -- it'll walk you through the oauth2 stuff including launching your browser</li>
<li>Install sendxmpp</li>
<li>Make your local install of sendxmpp work with the SSL requirements from google by editing and <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-gistfile1-pl">forcing RC4-MD5</a>.</li>
<li>Download/tweak to suit your needs: <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-gcalcli_parse_tsv">gcalcli_parse_tsv</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-cal_im_reminder">cal_im_reminder</a>&nbsp;and install <a href="https://gist.github.com/muness/5778339#file-cal_im_reminder-L4">a cron job</a></li>
</ol>
