Kerth) have been a great resource in facilitating - or helping others facilitate - retrospectives.  I'll often leaf through them a day or two before a retrospective to remind myself of the framework (more on that in an forthcoming post), and to introduce new activities or create my own.

Something that neither of those books tackle directly is how to facilitate a distributed retrospective.  Given that <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com">we've</a> been running a few of those lately, I wanted to share some tips:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Your equipment matters</strong>.  It took us a while to find a speaker phone that worked well for those in the office and those on the other end.  It's hard enough to communicate effectively without being in the same room, without muffled voices.  We use a Polycom unit with two extensions for a 20x16 room.</li>
 <li>Prepare.  There's a lot of preparation that goes into running a retrospective in person.  You have to <strong>familiarize yourself with the project, look for a theme, send out invitations, pick activities (and backup activities in case one isn't working), and collect the tools/resources you need for those activities.</strong></li>
 <li><a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> is your friend.  With its near real time updates for viewers and collaborators, it's been an indispensable tool to take notes.  The facilitator or a scribe can update the document and others can see what's happening, on the fly.</li>
 <li>It's not enough to use a Google Doc, you need to turn it into an online workspace that makes others feel like they're part of the process.  For example, I prepare a google document with activities scheduled for the retrospective.  I take care to:
 <ul>
  <li>Clearly state activity names.  When we move to the next one, it's enough to say its name and everyone can easily find the appropriate section.</li>
  <li>Describe the activity.  <strong>Having a written description allows people who miss the spoken description to follow the intent as well as the process involved</strong>.  Missing a description over a conference call can happen for all sorts of reasons, from people being more easily distracted, to phone problems.</li>
  <li>State the targeted time for the activity.  People are even more restless on a conference call.  This gives them a sense of the overall meeting's timeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy or summarize information from previous retrospective documents</strong> for ease of reference.</li>
 </ul>
        <li>Share with others.  Sharing the document with others as collaborators (rather than just viewers) gives them the confidence that they can correct mistakes.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to <strong>send an email shortly before the meeting that serves as a reminder, repeats the phone number/conference line details and includes a link to the Google Doc</strong> for that meeting.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>
I've shared a <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dchgzgwd_20cnnwffgs">Google Doc template</a> for a 2 hour iteration retrospective for 4 to 8 people you can refer to or use as a starting point for your own living retrospective document.  Credit goes to Agile Retrospectives for the activities.
