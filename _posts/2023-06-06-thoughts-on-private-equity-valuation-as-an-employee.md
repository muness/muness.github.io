title: 'Thoughts on private equity valuation as an employee'

## tl;dr

no, that startup offer isn't your ticket to big $$$.

## Exploring private equity valuations

**Note**: This is not financial advice. It's a synthesis of my notes, shared with others for educational and entertainment purposes.

Over the last few weeks I've been exploring job opportunities and many of these happened to be with early startups (seed to series B). As I was going through that I wanted to have a framework for how to evaluate the compensation of potential opportunities that include private company equity.

The ways I explored this:

- I asked in the communities I participate in including the Rands Leadership Slack, the ex-Shopify Slack about their startup experiences and how they value the equity component of compensation.
- I talked to friends and former colleagues in person, in chats and video calls.
- I searched for resources, reviewing them, summarizing them using [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/reader/update-may2023#:~:text=First%2DClass%20Summarization%20%F0%9F%A4%8F%F0%9F%A5%87) and [Shortform](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shortform-summarize-web-%20/anfegbjckcheemfbibglojdmjadgiepe).
- Synthesizing my thoughts in this post. I write to think.

### Reactions from friends and broader community

Some of the themese I heard:

- Private company equity is worth $0.
- A lot are seeing hesitation from larger companies with frozen or delayed hiring cycles.
- Holding stock that you can't sell without board approval, even with a ready buyer is an interesting experience. If something is only worth what you can sell it for, is it worth $0 if the board won't let you sell?
- Early stage equity is like a lottery ticket.
- It's OK to take a big cut to go work for a startup and take a big swing. If it doesn't work out, people in tech understand startup failure, and as of 2022, that layoffs are par for the course.

### Equity-specific questions

Here's a list of equity compensations questions to ask the company. I gathered these while going through the above resources.

- What is the company's current 409A valuation? When was it done?
- What is the vesting schedule of your employment contract? What happens if the company is acquired or I leave?
- How many outstanding shares are there?
- What is the strike/exercise price per share? What is the fair market value (FMV) per share?
- When do you plan to raise your next round of funding?
- What is the time horizon for potential sale/IPO?
- What are the previous secondary sales (by employees/founders), if any?
- What are the constraints on the ability to sell shares privately?
- Does the employment agreement give me the option to sell shares as part of future rounds of fundraising?
- Are they any debt or investments with  >1x liquidation preference?
- How long after departing company do you have to excercise your options?

## Will this startup offer make me the next (b|m)illionaire?

No. Well, almost certainly no. VCs are in the business of investing in a large number of companies such that a small percentage, I usually hear 1% thrown around, will lead to many order of magnitutude returns. Even with an amazing founding team, excellent hiring and luck, the odds are against you joining one of those.

Total compensation should not be the sole factor in taking a job with a startup. If the primary utility you get from a job is salary, you're (probably) going to find a better payout by taking on a position where the total compensation is in the form of salary. Instead consider a startup offer based on things that matter to you.

## What will make up compensation for _you_ ?

Some things I value as much if not more than salary include:

- passion for the mission.
- impact.
- the ability for the company to prioritize to best further their mission.
- mutual respect.
- opportunities to be challenged and learn.
- how much I enjoy my coworkers.
- the ability to do good work and help others.
- how much I'll be able to grow my network and build deep relationships.

Figure out what matters to you, and what you're going to get out of that next gig. It doesn't have to be salary and nothing else.

## Good luck!

If you're out there these days looking for a gig, my heart goes out to you, I know it's hard. You'll land somewhere that's right for you even if it takes a while or isn't what you were expecting.
