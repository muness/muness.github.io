# From Execution to Navigation

Knowledge Work After Scarcity

There’s a recurring problem I keep running into when I try to explain what’s changing about knowledge work in a world with LLMs.

People latch onto the wrong thing.

They focus on speed. Or accuracy. Or automation. Or where “judgment happens.” Those are all real effects, but they’re surface features. They’re symptoms, not the shift itself.

What’s actually happening is a phase change in knowledge work. And most people are still interpreting examples using pre-LLM categories, so they miss what the examples are evidence of.

“Judgment timing” is just the easiest crack to see. It’s not the fabric.

The real shift

LLMs don’t just move judgment earlier.

They change:
	1.	What counts as work
	2.	What expertise looks like
	3.	What coordination costs dominate
	4.	What failure modes matter
	5.	What leadership optimizes for
	6.	What it means to be responsible

Taken together, these changes add up to something larger than “better tools.”

A useful way to name it is this:

Knowledge work is shifting from execution under scarcity to navigation under abundance.

Almost everything I’ve written over the last year fits under that sentence.

Before this shift, knowledge work assumed scarcity:
	•	Options were scarce
	•	Iteration was expensive
	•	Plans were linear
	•	Expertise was heroic
	•	Review was how safety happened
	•	Output was how progress was measured

After the shift:
	•	Options are abundant
	•	Exploration is cheap
	•	Paths branch
	•	Expertise is editorial
	•	Pruning is how safety happens
	•	Learning is how progress is measured

The reason mundane examples, like an accounting workflow choosing the right path automatically, feel surprisingly important is that they show this shift without abstraction.

1. From execution to search

In the old model, work meant correctly executing a known sequence of steps. You planned, you committed, you executed, and you reviewed at the end.

That model made sense when exploring alternatives was expensive. You couldn’t afford to search broadly, so you chose early and went deep.

In the new model, work increasingly looks like search: exploring, evaluating, and selecting among plausible paths before committing to one. Execution still matters, but it’s no longer the primary bottleneck.

This is the core idea behind Beyond the Nearest Peak, the slot machine vs tree search distinction, and the “shallow → score → deepen” pattern. The value isn’t that the system produces an answer faster. It’s that it searches the state space before committing.

That’s a different job.

2. “Just Do It” is not the right response either

There’s an easy overcorrection once people accept that exploration is cheap: just move faster. Try everything. Ship first. Figure it out later.

I ran into this explicitly in a conversation with many business leaders: if you don’t know whether A or B is better, try both. See what happens. Learn.

That instinct isn’t wrong. But it’s incomplete.

Cheap exploration doesn’t mean indiscriminate execution. Acting without clarifying intent, constraints, or what would count as “better” just creates more output to unwind later. It collapses exploration and execution into the same move.

This is the mistake I tried to name in Beyond the Nearest Peak. Many teams don’t move too slowly. They commit too early to the wrong dimension of the problem. They optimize fonts, prompts, or implementations while leaving the hard question untouched: what kind of solution space are we actually in?

Navigation separates exploration from commitment. You explore in ways that are cheap and reversible. You execute only once you’ve learned something worth committing to.

The goal isn’t maximal action. It’s better commitment.

1. From skill stacking to configuration discovery

Under scarcity, expertise meant possession. You accumulated skills so you could handle whatever showed up. Depth had to be built in advance because you couldn’t cheaply simulate alternatives.

Under abundance, expertise shifts toward evaluation. The scarce skill isn’t generating possibilities anymore. It’s knowing how to assess them, how to score them against constraints, and how to decide where depth is worth investing.

This is why “skill stacking” quietly turns into something else. Instead of accumulating skills linearly, you explore hypothetical combinations of skills, tools, people, and constraints inside the simulation to see what might work before investing.

The key shift is simple but profound:

Expertise moves from possession to evaluation.

Depth still matters. But it’s applied later, more selectively, and with more confidence about where it will compound.

4. From plans to decision surfaces

When exploration is cheap, plans rot faster than they’re written.

This is the throughline connecting Planning, Not Plans, Alignment Is the Constraint, and Intent Engineering. The job is no longer to specify a brittle sequence of steps. It’s to create a navigable decision surface.

That means defining:
	•	Intent
	•	Constraints
	•	Scoring functions
	•	Acceptable failure modes

In other words, you don’t encode “what to do.” You encode how to decide.

This is why small workflow examples matter. In the accounting case, the system didn’t encode expense logic. It encoded the ability to interpret state and choose a path. That’s the work.

5. From review-as-safety to pruning-as-safety

The old safety model assumed humans would review outputs and catch mistakes at the end. This worked tolerably when decisions were rare and execution was slow.

When exploration is cheap, this model quietly fails. Review doesn’t reduce risk; it concentrates it. Humans become the liability sink for errors introduced upstream, often under time pressure and without context.

This is the reverse-centaur trap.

The new safety model moves upstream. Humans shape the space so fewer bad paths exist in the first place. Risk is reduced not by more review, but by fewer wrong commitments.

That’s why the accounting example matters. It reduced risk not by adding checks, but by eliminating a class of errors entirely.

6. From transaction costs in coordination to transaction costs in cognition

A lot of discussion about efficiency focuses on visible coordination costs: meetings, hand-offs, approvals.

But much of the overhead in knowledge work lives elsewhere. It lives in vigilance. Remembering exceptions. Noticing anomalies. Reconstructing intent after the fact. Cognitive bookkeeping.

When systems reason about state and intent up front, those costs drop. Not because the system is “smarter,” but because fewer edge cases escape into the world.

This is why the benefit feels different. It’s not just time saved. It’s fewer interruptions, fewer late surprises, and less mental load.

The system is cheaper because it asks for less human vigilance.

7. From responsibility as blame to responsibility as design

In the old model, responsibility was tied to approval. You signed off, so you owned the outcome.

In the new model, responsibility shifts upstream. The question becomes not “who approved this,” but “why was this path possible at all.”

This is why these ideas resonate with senior leaders. Responsibility moves to where leverage actually is: shaping intent, constraints, and decision surfaces.

Old responsibility:
You approved it. You own the mistake.

New responsibility:
You shaped the space in which the decision was made.

This is harder work. It’s also the only work that scales.

Why this has been hard to explain

People keep asking questions from the old frame:

“Is this faster?”
“Is this more accurate?”
“Is this automation?”

And the work I’m describing answers a different question:

What kind of work is this now?

That requires a new mental model, not a better example.

The shift doesn’t announce itself loudly. It shows up in small cases where work simply goes wrong less often. Where cleanup disappears. Where judgment moves earlier and becomes more valuable.

Once you see it, many familiar practices start to look misaligned: review-heavy workflows, overbuilt plans, late-stage heroics, pride in execution over navigation.

Execution isn’t gone.
It’s just no longer the hard part.

Navigation is.

Perfect. This is exactly the right sequencing.

Below are:
	1.	Appendices you can drop in verbatim (clean, structured, non-repetitive)
	2.	A precise diagram spec you can hand directly to Gamma (or any designer) without interpretation gaps

I’ve written the appendices so they reinforce the essay rather than restate it, and the diagram spec so it visually encodes the phase change, not just labels it.

Appendices

Appendix A: Why “Where Judgment Happens” Is an Incomplete Frame

A lot of discussion about AI in knowledge work focuses on where judgment happens: early versus late, upstream versus downstream. That distinction matters, but on its own it’s incomplete.

Judgment timing is a symptom of a deeper shift, not the shift itself. It becomes visible because it’s one of the first places the old model breaks. But focusing only on judgment risks missing what actually changed.

What changed is the cost structure of exploration.

When exploration was expensive, committing early and reviewing late was rational. Judgment had to happen at the end because there was nowhere else for it to go. When exploration becomes cheap, judgment moves earlier not by preference, but by necessity. It has more leverage there.

So when examples like the invoice workflow feel subtle but important, it’s because they reveal a new organizing principle for work. Judgment timing follows from that principle. It isn’t the principle itself.

Appendix B: The “Just Do It” Misread

One common misreading of this shift is to equate cheap exploration with constant action.

If trying things is cheap, the thinking goes, then the right response is to move faster, try everything, and let the results sort themselves out. This collapses exploration and execution into the same move.

That instinct mistakes motion for learning.

Cheap exploration changes how you should explore, not whether exploration needs structure. Acting without clarifying intent, constraints, or what would count as “better” simply produces more output to unwind later. The cost hasn’t disappeared; it’s been deferred.

Navigation requires separating reversible exploration from irreversible commitment. You explore broadly and cheaply. You commit narrowly and deliberately. “Just do it” skips the part where learning actually happens.

Appendix C: A Checklist for Navigation-Oriented Work

This is not a how-to, but a way to recognize whether work has shifted from execution to navigation.

Before committing to depth, ask:
	•	What are the plausible interpretations of this situation?
	•	What constraints actually matter here?
	•	What would count as a better outcome?
	•	What paths can we cheaply rule out now?
	•	What are we intentionally not doing yet?

If these questions feel unnecessary, the work is probably still execution-dominated. If they feel essential, navigation has already taken over.
