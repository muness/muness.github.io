## A few job search tips

This good folks at [Quantix](https://www.quantixinc.com/) recently set up a networking group for some IT executives. The idea is to create a community for those of us looking for positions to connect and learn from one another's experience.

### Some tips we talked about

Today we had our first call. We did a round of introductions and the Quantix folks asked us about our journey and shared some tips. Here are some of the ones I captured. I include my reaction: ✅ = yep, I am good at this, 💡 = that's worth a change/trial, 🎗️ = advice I have for you, dear reader, ⚙️ = tool I found.

- Some say that the frame on LinkedIn profile of OpenToWork has led to _fewer_ interviews.
  - Suggested removing it and trying that.
  - ✅ Seemed worth a try, done.
- A lot of what's happening is that a lot of people are applying. As a result there's an aggressive filtering step. One of those is to cut anyone with any mismatches between LinkedIn Profiles and resume.
  - ✅ Double checked my resume and profile.
- After cold applying to positions check to see if you have a connection to the hiring manager or recruiter and ask to put in an introduction/ good word in on your behalf.
  - 💡 I need to do a better job at this:
    - I've applied to a dozen or so jobs that I've gotten either automated rejections from or radio silence.
    - I have several offers for help through networks that I have not taken advantage of.
- Can leave last position in LinkedIn, probably not an issue.
- Do the basics
  - before the interview: look up the company, look up the interviewer, learn about the product.
    - ✅ I look up the company, interviewer before meeting with them.
    - 💡 I try to learn more about the product, but I feel like I can do more here. At the very least I could ask the recruiter to send me materials to read or demo links.
  - after each interview: follow up with a thank you. use email as LinkedIn often gets buried.
    - don't be too pushy following up with emails or connecting via LinkedIn unless they offer follow up. Go through the recruiter.
      - 💡 While I sent a thank you note _most_ of the time, I don't always do it. Gotta step it up.
- Show up with a positive attitude, express energy, that often makes the difference. Don't fake it though; what's the point of getting a job you don't want.
  - ✅ I think I do a good job with this, showing up, focusing on what I am find exciting or asking hard questions when I am not sure.
  - 🎗️ Remember: this is your opportunity to interview the company too, do it and find exciting things about the position.
- Work on your pitch. You start every conversation with one, it's worth the investment. Get it to be succinct and direct. Get to the meat of your strengths and highlights.
  - 💡 I have a decent elevator pitch, but it's worth a concerted effort and trial run with a friend.
- Check that your resume parses correctly. Some tools I found
  - ⚙️ [Resume Parser by Affinda](https://www.affinda.com/resume-parser) - check the json file generated! It's pretty cool how it extracts skills from each position listed. I imagine some companies lean on this to do a filter pass.
  - ⚙️ [Resume Parser](https://resume-parser.vercel.app/) - if this one's right, my resume currently only parses the overview. Yikes!

And I'll add one more:

- 🎗️ you're not alone! Find a peer group, share your tips, and ask for help.
