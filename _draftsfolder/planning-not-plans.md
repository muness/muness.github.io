# Planning not plans: Rolling 90 Day Priorities

## What is this?

This is a comprehensive, adaptive framework I've developed and refined over the years to guide personal and professional growth. At its core, the methodology is anchored in the principle of **acting with intent**. By examining my history, understanding my strengths, and setting forth a clear mission, I can aim with precision and confidence.

Military strategist and President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said,
> "Plans are nothing; planning is everything."

This encapsulates the essence of my approach. While static plans can become obsolete in the face of rapidly changing circumstances, the act of planning equips us with the flexibility, insight, and resilience to adapt and pivot as needed. The framework isn't about meticulously crafted plans set in stone; it's about cultivating a mindset of preparation, agility, and continuous learning.

Several criteria came up as I've iterated over this framework:

- **Clarity of Direction:**
  > "If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there." – Lewis Carroll

  It's imperative to have clear priorities and understand the rationale behind them.
- **Reality-Check:** Grounding our objectives in past achievements ensures they're rooted in reality and builds on proven strengths.

- **Proactive Living:**
  > "The future depends on what you do today." – Mahatma Gandhi

  The world is full of distractions and external demands. This framework ensures we don't become passive recipients of life's agenda but active directors of our destiny.
- **Adaptive Evolution:** Life's only constant is change. A robust system needs to be easy to update, reflecting evolving goals and circumstances.

- **Quick Recovery:** By focusing on short, 90-day sprints, this approach fosters a "fail fast, learn faster" attitude. If a certain direction proves unfruitful, little time is wasted, and course corrections can be made swiftly.

So, while the detailed plans may evolve, the process of planning, with its introspection, foresight, and adaptability guide me.

1. **Reflect on Achievements:** Document your proudest professional moments. Think of how they made a difference in terms of revenue, user experience, or other tangible impacts.
2. **Recognize Your Strengths:** Examine your achievements and discern the skills that helped you accomplish them. Tools like the Enneagram or Working Genius can provide insights.
3. **Affirm Your Mission:** Create a personal mission statement. Think about what you want to be remembered for.
4. **Set Priorities:** Combining the “Aim” and “Identify small wins” steps, list your growth areas for the next quarter. Ensure that these align with your mission, leverage your strengths, and can be realistically achieved in three months. These priorities will be your focus areas, guiding your efforts for the next 90 days.
5. **Weekly Priorities Review:** Each week, review your set priorities and adjust based on current circumstances, opportunities, or challenges. Look for ways to leverage your unique strengths and the current situation to progress towards your quarterly outcomes.

When you first implement this system, the investment level is high. Aim to do one to two activities a week. And once you've tried it a couple of times, make it your own.

### 1. Reflect on Achievements

Before setting future goals, it's crucial to recognize and celebrate past successes. Reflecting on achievements provides motivation and a clear understanding of capabilities.

**Tips:**

- Maintain a monthly or weekly log of your accomplishments.
- Don't just list tasks completed; note the impact they had.
- Share your accomplishments with a mentor or colleague to gain perspective.

### 2. Know Your Strengths

Recognizing your strengths gives you an edge. It enables you to play to your advantages, making tasks more effortless and impactful.

**Tips:**

- Request feedback from peers and supervisors.
- Reflect on the tasks you found most engaging and fulfilling.
- Consider using psychometric tests. Don't just take the results at face value; reflect on them and discuss them with others and make your own conclusions about your strengths.

### 3. Aim

Your mission or aim provides direction. It's the compass guiding your tasks, goals, and ambitions.

**Tips:**

- Visualize where you want to be in 3-5 years.
- Determine the skills and knowledge you need to acquire to get there.
- Revisit and refine your aim periodically.

### 4. How Do I Use 90-Day Priorities?

90-day priorities aren't just a list of tasks. They’re a structured approach to growth, aligning daily tasks with longer-term goals and aspirations.

**Tips:**

- Every week, break down your priorities into actionable tasks. Consider: what is the one most important thing I can do this week to move towards this priority?
- Review your priorities regularly.
- Adjust as needed based on progress and changing circumstances.

## Embracing the Journey

Reflecting on my last few years, I've come to realize that while our goals seem appealing, it's the process — rooted in intentional planning, adaptability, and continuous learning — that has unleashed my growth and reinforced a growth mindset. This framework has taught me to value lessons, challenge, and the guidance I receive along my journey.

But here's the beautiful part: this isn't just my story. The essence of this approach is universally applicable. While I've laid out my experiences and methods, the core principles can resonate with anyone, anywhere. It's not just about setting goals but the deliberation, the reflection, and the intentional steps we take towards them. It's about harnessing the power of focused intent, the beauty of adaptability, and the joy of continuous learning. I've used adaptations of the framework to plan teams, help friends get over existential crises and in my coaching.

Dive in, make it yours, and tell me about it. How did it work for you? Where did you tweak? I'd love to hear your stories!
