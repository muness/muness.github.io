# Outcomes and Outputs: A book summary

In _[Outcomes Over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes)_, Joshua Seiden advocates for a shift from the traditional output-driven approach to a more outcome-centered mindset in product development. He scrutinizes the inflexibility of adhering to predefined outputs which often don't align with the evolving needs and expectations of users.

This resonates well with a [notion](https://userguiding.com/blog/ux-design-quotes/#:~:text=4%2D%20%E2%80%9COur%20goal%20is%20not%20to%20create%20a%20deliverable%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20to%20change%20something%20in%20the%20world%20%E2%80%94%20to%20create%20an%20outcome.%E2%80%9D) shared by Jeff Gothelf, author of Lean UX, “Our goal is not to create a deliverable, it’s to change something in the world — to create an outcome."

Before we delve deeper, let's clarify the distinction between outputs and outcomes:

- **Outputs** refer to the tangible, direct artifacts or deliverables produced through efforts. They are quantifiable and can be easily measured but don't reflect the value or impact created for users or stakeholders. For instance, developing a certain number of features or completing tasks are examples of outputs.
- **Outcomes**, on the other hand, are the changes or benefits that occur as a result of the outputs. They reflect the value delivered to users and are about changing behavior or impression. For instance, improved user satisfaction, increased engagement, or achieving a significant milestone are examples of outcomes.

## The Essence of Outcomes

Seiden's emphasis on outcomes as smaller, manageable targets aligns with the ethos of flexible planning. He critiques high-level, ambiguous goals stating, "These impact-level targets are too complex to be useful to our teams.

Instead, we need to ask our teams to work on outcomes—the smaller, more manageable targets that, taken together, will create the impact we want. We do this by asking them to focus on changing customer behavior in a way that drives business results." This resonates with Goldratt's take in [Strategy & Tactics Trees](/posts/on-s-and-t-trees/).

## Redefining MVP

The concept of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is pivotal in modern product development, particularly in agile and lean methodologies. However, misconceptions abound, and Seiden provides a refreshing perspective that aligns with the ethos of adaptive planning. Here's a breakdown of his insights and the broader implications.

### Shifting the MVP Paradigm

- **Beyond Version 1.0**: Traditionally, MVP is often misconstrued as the first full version of a product. Seiden dismantles this notion by stating, "An MVP is NOT version 1.0 of your product." This distinction is crucial as it shifts the focus from delivering a set of predefined features to learning and validation.

- **Learning Over Features**: Seiden advises to view the _MVP as, "the smallest thing you can do or the smallest thing you can make to learn if your hypothesis is correct."_ This reflects a learning-centric approach where the primary goal is to validate assumptions and gather insights with the least effort.

### Embracing a Leaner Approach

- **Lean Validation**: The redefined MVP is about lean validation—testing the critical assumptions with minimal resources. It’s about discovering what resonates with the users and what doesn’t before investing heavily in development.

- **Early Customer Feedback**: This approach encourages collecting early feedback from real users. It's not about creating a polished product, but about understanding user needs and preferences.

### Adaptive Planning

- **Iterative Development**: Seiden's take on MVP reinforces the importance of iterative development. By starting with a minimal viable product (as defined above!), teams can learn, adapt, and iterate, thereby reducing risks and ensuring that the product evolves in line with user needs and market demands.

- **Feedback Loops**: The emphasis is on creating short feedback loops to continuously learn from user interactions and make informed decisions. This dynamic approach allows for real-time adjustments and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.

### Broader Implications

- **Risk Mitigation**: By validating assumptions early, teams can identify potential pitfalls and make necessary adjustments, mitigating risks associated with product development.

- **Resource Optimization**: This understanding of MVP promotes a judicious use of resources—focusing on what’s essential for learning and validation rather than over-investing in untested features.

- **Fostering a Learning Culture**: The redefinition of MVP underscores a shift towards a learning-oriented culture, where every stage of product development is an opportunity for learning and growth.

Seiden's perspective on MVP promotes a culture of experimentation, learning, and continuous improvement in the realm of product development.

## Shifting Organizational Focus

The book notes the propensity of organizations to structure around products or channels rather than behaviors or customer journeys, which inadvertently places more emphasis on outputs over outcomes. Seiden says, "so often, our organizations are set up around product or channel vs. behavior or customer journey. And when we do that, we’re implicitly de-prioritizing outcomes and prioritizing outputs."

In the context of technology initiatives, this shift means transcending traditional metrics like features delivered (or points delivered!), and instead, focusing on new behaviors encouraged by the work. It's a move from output-based planning, which often struggles with prioritization due to a disconnect from value delivery, to an outcome-based approach where success metrics are established upfront. This approach encourages continuous assessment and iteration, enabling teams to realign efforts based on performance reviews, and pivot when necessary to ensure value delivery.

While he doesn't discuss technical debt explicitly, Seiden implies that while addressing technical debt is important, it should be tied to the broader goal of enabling new capabilities. The _management of technical debt is not an end in itself_ but a means to facilitate better outcomes, both for users and the organization.

Seiden highlights the importance of clarity in intention by mentioning, "In outcome-based work, teams need to be really clear about the value they are trying to create, and they do this by specifying two critical outcomes of the work: the outcome they are seeking for the customer or user, and the outcome they are seeking for the business. These two outcomes must be linked."

This shift necessitates establishing clear hypotheses and success measures before embarking on a project. Seiden shares a narrative, “For us it’s about establishing hypotheses and measures of success before we start on an effort,”... “If the change looks like it’s working, we look for other areas of the business to work on. If it’s not working like we thought it would, it raises the priority and we take another run at it.”

I think of this as an explicit statement of the mechanism of action, which is often implicit in traditional planning. For example, by listing this mechanism of action: "By adding a personalized recommendation feature, we expect to enhance user engagement, leading to an increase in the average time spent on the platform and a 10% uptick in monthly active users," we now have hypothesis that can be tested and evaluated.

- **Action**: Adding a personalized recommendation feature.
- **Expected Outcomes**: Enhanced user engagement, increased average time spent on the platform, and a 10% uptick in monthly active users.
- **Leading Indicators**:
  - **User Engagement Metrics**: Interaction rates with the recommendation feature, click-through rates, and the rate of return visits can be early indicators of whether the personalized recommendation feature is engaging users as intended.
  - **Average Session Duration**: Any noticeable change in the average time spent on the platform post-implementation can provide immediate feedback on the feature's impact.
  - **User Feedback**: Collecting user feedback on the new feature can provide early insights into its acceptance and effectiveness.

By identifying such leading indicators, the team can monitor the feature. This allows for a more iterative approach to evaluation, where data on user engagement and session duration can be analyzed in days not weeks. If the leading indicators show unfavorable trends, the team can quickly adjust or abort the initiative without having to wait for the long-term outcome of monthly active user growth.

Through these insights, Seiden propels the idea of moving away from a feature-centric planning to a more holistic, outcome-driven planning, ensuring that the work done is aligned with the value it's intended to deliver. He reflects on the challenge of prioritization in a feature-based planning model, "the feature-based way of planning work had made it hard to prioritize work. This is a basic problem of output-based planning. How can you figure out what features are important if you aren’t sure which features will deliver value?"

## Articulating Problems, Not Solutions

Seiden underscores a shift from a traditional solution-centric approach to a more problem-centric paradigm. Here's a breakdown of this transformation.

### Understanding the Problem First

- **Problem Definition**: Before jumping to solutions, understand and articulate the problem at hand. This involves identifying the pain points, challenges, or opportunities that the project aims to address. A well-defined problem provides a clear direction and a shared understanding for the team.

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing baseline data helps understand the current state and sets a benchmark against which progress can be measured.

### Hypothesis-Driven Development

- **Formulating Hypotheses**: Once the problem is understood, formulate hypotheses about how they might solve the problem or take advantage of an opportunity. These hypotheses help maintain focus on achieving the desired outcomes.

- **Testing and Learning**: Hypothesis-driven development encourages a culture of experimentation and learning. It's about validating assumptions, learning from failures, and iterating based on feedback and results.

### Shifting the Intake Paradigm

- **From Features to Problems**: Traditionally, requests in project management often come in the form of feature requests. However, Seiden advocates for a shift where requests are framed in terms of problems to be solved. The quote, "Instead of requesting features, 'the ticket submission template asked for the problem, the hypotheses, baseline data, and what they hoped to achieve,'" exemplifies this shift.

- **Outcome-Focused Requests**: This problem-centric approach promotes a focus on outcomes rather than outputs. It challenges teams to think about the impact and value they aim to deliver, rather than getting bogged down with feature lists.

### Advantages

- **Better Alignment**: This approach ensures that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the _why_ behind the project, fostering alignment among teams.

- **Increased Flexibility and Innovation**: By focusing on problems rather than predetermined solutions, teams are empowered to explore innovative solutions and adapt to changing circumstances.

- **Measurable Impact**: It promotes a culture of measurement and continuous improvement, where success is evaluated based on the actual impact and the achievement of desired outcomes.

By espousing a problem-centric approach, Seiden sets the stage for a more thoughtful, outcome-oriented, and adaptive project management paradigm that aligns closely with modern agile and lean methodologies. There's more on this problem rather than solution-oriented approach in [Design In Practice](/posts/design-in-practice-writeup/).

## Takeaways

_Outcomes Over Output_ encourages transforming how teams think and work, echoing sentiments I've shared in [Planning, not plans](https://muness.com/posts/planning-not-plans/). This evolution towards solutions that deliver customer value and business growth paves the way for a more impactful and customer-centric product development process. Seiden elaborates, "Expressing the change you seek in terms of outcomes allows you to build change programs that very specifically target the behaviors you want to promote."

Additional insights include the importance of observation and measurability in managing outcomes, the challenge of shifting thinking from features to outcomes, and the separation of responsibility necessitating a tight working relationship for effective outcome management.

At only 86 pages, it's a quick read. I hope this summary serves as a reference for you. If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading the book.
