# Outcomes and Outputs: A book summary

In _[Outcomes Over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes)_, Joshua Seiden champions a shift from the traditional output-driven approach towards a more outcome-centered mindset in product development. He criticizes the rigidity of sticking to predefined outputs which often don't align with the evolving needs and expectations of users.

This resonates well with a [notion](https://userguiding.com/blog/ux-design-quotes/#:~:text=4%2D%20%E2%80%9COur%20goal%20is%20not%20to%20create%20a%20deliverable%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20to%20change%20something%20in%20the%20world%20%E2%80%94%20to%20create%20an%20outcome.%E2%80%9D) shared by Jeff Gothelf, author of Lean UX, “Our goal is not to create a deliverable, it’s to change something in the world — to create an outcome."

Before we move on, let's clarify the distinction between outputs and outcomes:

- **Outputs** refer to the tangible, direct artifacts or deliverables produced through efforts. They are quantifiable and can be easily measured but don't reflect the value or impact created for users or stakeholders. For instance, developing a certain number of features or completing tasks are examples of outputs.
- **Outcomes**, on the other hand, are the changes or benefits that occur as a result of the outputs. They reflect the value delivered to users and are about changing behavior or impression. For instance, improved user satisfaction, increased engagement, or achieving a significant milestone are examples of outcomes.

> Our goal is not to create a deliverable, it’s to change something in the world — to create an outcome.

## The Essence of Outcomes

Seiden's advocacy for outcomes as smaller, manageable targets rings true with the ethos of flexible planning. He criticizes high-level, ambiguous goals stating, “These impact-level targets are too complex to be useful to our teams.” This aligns with Goldratt's take in [Strategy & Tactics Trees](/posts/on-s-and-t-trees/).

## Redefining MVP

Seiden’s take on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) reverberates with the ethos of adaptive planning. He clarifies, "An MVP is NOT version 1.0 of your product... the smallest thing you can do or make to learn if your hypothesis is correct."

## Internal Technology Initiatives

Shifting the narrative from feature production to organizational behavior measurement, Seiden criticizes the common practice of measuring progress in terms of features produced. He suggests measuring new outcomes (behavior changes!) created by the work as a more meaningful indicator of progress.

## Articulating Problems, Not Solutions

Echoing the sentiment of articulating problems over dictating solutions, Seiden marks a shift from requesting features to a more problem-centric approach. He notes, "the feature-based way of planning work had made it hard to prioritize work."

## Takeaways

_Outcomes Over Output_ orchestrates a pragmatic shift towards transforming how teams and organizations think and work, echoing the sentiments shared in ["Planning, not plans"](https://muness.com/posts/planning-not-plans/). This subtle, grounded evolution towards effective solutions that maximize customer value and foster business growth paves the way for a more impactful and customer-centric product development process.

At only 86 pages, it's a quick read. I hope this brief summary serves as a reference for you. If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading the book.
