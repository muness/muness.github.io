# Outcomes and Outputs: A book summary

In _[Outcomes Over Output](https://www.senseandrespondpress.com/managing-outcomes)_, Joshua Seiden advocates for a shift from the traditional output-driven approach to a more outcome-centered mindset in product development. He scrutinizes the inflexibility of adhering to predefined outputs which often don't align with the evolving needs and expectations of users.

This resonates well with a [notion](https://userguiding.com/blog/ux-design-quotes/#:~:text=4%2D%20%E2%80%9COur%20goal%20is%20not%20to%20create%20a%20deliverable%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20to%20change%20something%20in%20the%20world%20%E2%80%94%20to%20create%20an%20outcome.%E2%80%9D) shared by Jeff Gothelf, author of Lean UX, “Our goal is not to create a deliverable, it’s to change something in the world — to create an outcome."

Before we delve deeper, let's clarify the distinction between outputs and outcomes:

- **Outputs** refer to the tangible, direct artifacts or deliverables produced through efforts. They are quantifiable and can be easily measured but don't reflect the value or impact created for users or stakeholders. For instance, developing a certain number of features or completing tasks are examples of outputs.
- **Outcomes**, on the other hand, are the changes or benefits that occur as a result of the outputs. They reflect the value delivered to users and are about changing behavior or impression. For instance, improved user satisfaction, increased engagement, or achieving a significant milestone are examples of outcomes.

## The Essence of Outcomes

Seiden's emphasis on outcomes as smaller, manageable targets aligns with the ethos of flexible planning. He critiques high-level, ambiguous goals stating, "These impact-level targets are too complex to be useful to our teams.

Instead, we need to ask our teams to work on outcomes—the smaller, more manageable targets that, taken together, will create the impact we want. We do this by asking them to focus on changing customer behavior in a way that drives business results." This resonates with Goldratt's take in [Strategy & Tactics Trees](/posts/on-s-and-t-trees/).

## Redefining MVP

Seiden’s perspective on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) echoes the ethos of adaptive planning. He clarifies, "An MVP is NOT version 1.0 of your product. Instead, think of MVP as the smallest thing you can do or the smallest thing you can make to learn if your hypothesis is correct."

## Internal Technology Initiatives

Seiden challenges the common practice of measuring progress in terms of features produced. He suggests measuring new outcomes (behavior changes!) created by the work as a more meaningful indicator of progress:

> It would be better to instead measure progress in terms of new organizational behaviors created by their work.

## Articulating Problems, Not Solutions

Reiterating the importance of articulating problems over dictating solutions, Seiden marks a shift from requesting features to a more problem-centric approach

> Instead of requesting features, 'the ticket submission template asked for the problem, the hypotheses, baseline data, and what they hoped to achieve.'

## Takeaways

_Outcomes Over Output_ encourages transforming how teams and organizations think and work, echoing the sentiments shared in [Planning, not plans](https://muness.com/posts/planning-not-plans/). This evolution towards effective solutions that maximize customer value and foster business growth paves the way for a more impactful and customer-centric product development process. Seiden underscores, "Expressing the change you seek in terms of outcomes allows you to build change programs that very specifically target the behaviors you want to promote."

Additional insights include the importance of observation and measurability in managing outcomes, the challenge of shifting thinking from features to outcomes, and the separation of responsibility necessitating a tight working relationship for effective outcome management.

At only 86 pages, it's a quick read. I hope this brief summary serves as a reference for you. If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading the book.
