title: 'Intent Engineering: From Vibe Coding to Productive Outcomes'
---

## Introduction

Over the Memorial Day weekend, I set out to achieve flawless DSD-512 playback from my Minisforum UM790 Pro + RTX 3060 Ti eGPU running AudioLinux. My primary method was "Vibe Coding"‚Äîrapidly prototyping and iterating with AI assistants like ChatGPT. The speed was intoxicating, but without guardrails, I found myself spiraling into complexity and distraction.

Vibe Coding is neither hero nor villain; it simply amplifies our **action bias**. Accelerated action without structure often leads to wasted effort and hidden traps. In this essay, you‚Äôll explore:

1. **Why** Vibe Coding so easily careens into pitfalls.
2. **How** the **Design in Practice** framework provides a structured antidote.
3. **What** ‚ÄúIntent Engineering‚Äù is and how it fuses rapid iteration with deliberate checkpoints.
4. How to build an AI-assisted system specifically designed to support Intent Engineering.

## Setting the Scene

Along the way, I use examples from the audio project to illustrate how Vibe Coding can lead to both breakthroughs and pitfalls.
Audio Project Recap

* **Objective:** Uninterrupted, glitch-free DSD-512 oversampling to a fanless NAA endpoint.
* **Hardware:** UM790 Pro (Ryzen 9, 64 GB RAM) + NVIDIA 3060 Ti in Razer Core X.
* **Initial plan:** Stick with Windows 11 for CUDA simplicity; pivot to AudioLinux RT kernel when latency issues emerged.

## Vibe Coding is Rocket Fuel‚ÄîAim It

Accelerated action can feel empowering, but without intentional guidance, it often results in:

| Pitfall                | Manifestation                                  | Cost  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Unquestioned AI advice | Disabled iGPU ‚Üí no display ‚Üí blind CMOS resets | 2 hrs |
| Parameter sprawl       | Half-dozen conflicting kernel flags            | 3 hrs |
| Shiny-thing purchases  | Audiophile USB cables that fixed nothing       | \$40  |
| Local maxima loops     | Windows hacks hiding kernel latency            | 4 hrs |

> **Observation:** AI turbocharges *doing* before it strengthens *thinking*. We sprint into fixes, only to trip over our own speed.

This mirrors _Brownian motion_ in many organizations‚Äîfrantic activity that seldom maps to meaningful outcomes.

## Reflection: Accelerated Action Bias

* **Action bias**: our tendency to favor immediate action, even when pausing could yield better results.
* **Fixes That Fail**: quick patches relieve symptoms, but often generate worse problems.
* **Corporate echo**: teams rewarded for busyness, not for hitting strategic goals.

My midnight anecdote ordering overpriced cables underscores this: a \$40 impulse solved nothing, while a simple BIOS flag fix required no purchase and twenty minutes of focused thinking.

## Introducing **Design in Practice** ‚Äì The Structured Antidote

**Design in Practice** breaks problem-solving into six phases that serve as guardrails, aligning swift action with clarity:

1. **Describe:** State what you see‚Äîsymptoms and context‚Äîwithout interpretations or assumptions.
2. **Diagnose:** Propose hypotheses and design quick tests to uncover root causes.
3. **Delimit:** Narrow the problem to a precise statement, distinguishing cause from symptom.
4. **Direction:** Define success criteria, constraints, and priorities before diving in.
5. **Design:** Outline a solution sketch or flow, mapping components and dependencies.
6. **Develop:** Execute the smallest viable step and validate its impact immediately.

**Why it works:** These phases force strategic pauses that interrupt runaway action bias, ensuring each AI-driven iteration hits the right target.

**Practical Mini-Template:**

Use this during your next Intent Engineering session. At each pause, capture succinct answers to stay aligned:

```markdown
üîñ Project: ______________________________

1. Describe ‚ûî Symptoms/context: ________________________________
2. Diagnose ‚ûî Hypotheses & tests: ______________________________
3. Delimit ‚ûî Precise problem statement: ________________________
4. Direction ‚ûî Success criteria & constraints: _________________
5. Design ‚ûî Chosen approach: ___________________________________
6. Develop ‚ûî Immediate action & validation: ____________________
```

## Intent Engineering: Structured AI-Powered Iteration

To harness AI speed without losing control, apply **Intent Engineering**, interleaving rapid Vibe Coding bursts with intentional pauses:

1. **Clarify Intent**: Craft a concise goal in one sentence.
2. **Burst**: Spend 10 minutes generating AI-driven ideas and prototypes.
3. **Pause & Justify**: For each idea, ask if it's necessary, sufficient, and strategically appropriate.
4. **Structured Pass**: Pass validated ideas through the Six-Phase template.
5. **Iterate**: Alternate structured pauses and AI-assisted bursts until your intent is fulfilled.

**Gall‚Äôs Law** reminds us: complex systems evolve from simple ones. Each pause avoids unnecessary complexity.

## Sidebar: Building an AI-Assisted Intent Engineering System

To effectively support **Intent Engineering** with AI, we can architect a system that embeds the six phases of **Design in Practice** as distinct expert agents, orchestrated by a central ‚Äúphase router.‚Äù This router dynamically dispatches user prompts and AI outputs to the appropriate expert based on the current phase, ensuring a structured and coherent workflow.

### Phase Router and Expert Agents

At the heart of the system is the **phase router**, which acts as a traffic controller, directing inputs to specialized expert agents representing each Design in Practice phase: Describe, Diagnose, Delimit, Direction, Design, and Develop. Each expert is finely tuned to handle the unique reasoning and output style required for its phase, maintaining clarity and focus.

### Context Preprocessor

Before routing, a **context preprocessor** filters and compresses the user‚Äôs input and relevant project data, tailoring the context to the specific needs of the target phase. This ensures that each expert receives only the most pertinent information, reducing noise and improving response relevance.

### Constraint Gating with Automated Justification Checks

After the expert agent generates its output, the system applies a **constraint gating** step. This involves automated justification checks framed around necessity and sufficiency questions, prompting the AI (and user) to validate whether the proposed solution or hypothesis is essential and adequate. This step enforces deliberate reflection, preventing premature or unfounded decisions.

### Problem-Space Refinement Loop

If the output fails to satisfy these constraints, the system triggers a **problem-space refinement** loop. This loop routes the interaction back to earlier phases‚Äîtypically Describe or Diagnose‚Äîfor deeper exploration and clarification. This feedback mechanism ensures that unresolved issues are surfaced and addressed before moving forward.

### Chained Prompting and Phase Monitoring

Each user interaction may chain multiple prompts internally, passing outputs through several expert agents and gating steps in sequence. A lightweight **monitor** component tracks phase progression, detecting skipped or incomplete phases and issuing guardrail warnings. This mechanism helps maintain discipline, catching potential runaway Vibe Coding scenarios where critical phases might be bypassed.

### Guardrails for Structured Iteration

Together, these components form a robust guardrail system that enforces structured iteration and intentional pauses. By embedding continuous strategic checkpoints into the AI workflow, this architecture prevents the chaos of unchecked rapid action, guiding users safely through the complexity of Intent Engineering.

## Vibe-away, with Intent Engineering

Vibe Coding can rapidly propel your projects, but without structured checks and clear intent, it often accelerates into confusion. With deliberate **Intent Engineering**, we can leverage AI‚Äôs power productively.
